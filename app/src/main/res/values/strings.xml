    <string name="paper1">The research paper describes the design of a web based intelligent tutoring system for teaching Android Applications Development to students to overcome the difficulties they face. The basic idea of this system is a systematic introduction into the concept of Android Application Development. The system presents the topic of Android Application Development and administers automatically generated problems for the students to solve. The system is automatically adapted at run time to the studentâ€™s individual growth. The system provides obvious support for adaptive demonstration constructs. An initial assessment study was done to examine the effect of using the intelligent tutoring system on the performance of students enrolled in Smartphone Applications Development in the University College of Applied Sciences, Gaza. The results showed a positive impact on the evaluators.</string>
